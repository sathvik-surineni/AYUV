                    Chickenpox is a viral infection that is caused due to varicella-zoster virus. This virus spreads via
                    air or by direct contact with the infected person. It generally affects children aged below 10 years
                    but rarely occurs in adults. Chickenpox is mainly characterised by the appearance of itchy blisters
                    all over the body.
                    Taking chickenpox vaccine once between 10 and 15 months and once between 4 and 6 years is the best
                    preventive measure for this disease. However, even vaccinated children might get diagnosed with a
                    milder form of chickenpox.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Chickenpox is referred to as laghu masurika or masurika in Ayurveda. The term masurika comes from
                        the word masoor (red lentils) and is used in reference to the multiple red-coloured boils that
                        appear on the body during this illness.
                    </p>

                        contaminated peas or leafy green vegetables and excessive eating habits are considered as the

                        the skin) are some of the symptoms observed before the manifestation of this disease.
                        Small- or large-sized, reddish yellow-coloured blisters start appearing after 3 to 7 days, which
                        then give out a pus-like discharge and become scaly and dry.</p>
                </li>

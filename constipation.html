                    <p>Boost Immunity With Giloy
                        Giloy, a well-known immunity booster, helps in maintaining the metabolic rate, improving the immune system, and increasing the platelet count. A herbal drink can be made by boiling two small stems of Giloy plant in a glass of water until half a glass of water remains. Drink this Giloy infused water twice a day. Giloy helps in balancing the tridoshas.</p>

                    <p>Increase Platelet Count With Papaya Leaf
                        As the need of the hour is to increase the platelet count, Ayurveda strongly prescribes the papaya leaves juice for platelets. Papaya leaves juice also helps relieve tiredness, nausea, and stomach problems. You can prepare papaya leaf juice by crushing its leaves and extracting the juice. Drinking a small quantity of papaya leaf juice twice a day can offer great results.</p>

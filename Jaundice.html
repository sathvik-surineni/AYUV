                    Jaundice is also known as Icterus. It may happen at any age including infants, and adults. In
                    dealing with jaundice, the skin turns to yellowish color, and the white part of the eye is also
                    turned yellowish. It is due to the results of increased bile pigments and bilirubin in the blood.

            <h1>In View Of Ayurveda</h1>
            <p>In Ayurveda, Jaundice is known as "Kamala". As Ayurveda says, our body is preserved by three essential
                energies known as vata, pitta, and kapha. Ayurveda classifies Kamala as an apratyaksha(indirect)
                disease. Disorder in any of the three energies results in a problem in the body. Aggravation of pitta
                reasons is a liver disturbance. Ayurveda considers the malformation of Ranjak pitta(a subtype of pitta)
                as amenable for jaundice.
            </p>

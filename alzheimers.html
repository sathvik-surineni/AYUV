                    Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the progressively worsening of cognitive functions and behavioral disturbances; it is the most common form of primary dementia and mortality in the geriatric population. Although there is no precise equivalent for AD in Ayurveda, cognitive dysfunction has been described in convulsive disorders and with the aging process, which is known to be associated with physical and mental disability.
                    The major clinical manifestations of AD are memory disturbances, spatial and temporal disorientation, and getting lost in familiar surroundings. As the disease progresses, aphasia, apraxia, acalculia, and sleepwalking may develop.In Ayurveda, AD is considered age related with no specific etiology except that the vata dosha is involved. Conventional medicine is using several working hypotheses to find an effective treatment for AD and develop prevention strategies. These hypotheses include defective beta-amyloid protein metabolism; abnormalities of glutamatergic, adrenergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic, and cholinergic neurotransmission; and the potential involvement of inflammatory, oxidative, and hormonal pathways.

                    <p>It's important to note that Ayurveda should be seen as a complementary or supportive approach to conventional medical treatment for Alzheimer's disease, and any Ayurvedic treatments should be undertaken with the guidance of a qualified Ayurvedic practitioner.

                        Curcumin capsules Curcumin, a natural compound found in turmeric, has gained attention in recent years for its potential role in the treatment and management of Alzheimer's disease. However, it's important to note that while there is some promising research, curcumin is not a proven or standalone treatment for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Gotu kola (Centella asiatica), also known as Indian pennywort, is an herb traditionally used in Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicine for its potential cognitive and neuroprotective benefits./p>

                <li>
                    <p> While gotu kola has been studied for various health-related purposes, including its effects on memory and brain function, its role in treating Alzheimer's disease is not well-established, and it should not be considered a primary treatment for the condition.</p>

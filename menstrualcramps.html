                    Menstrual cramps, also known as dysmenorrhea, are a common gynecological condition experienced by many people with menstrual cycles. These cramps are often characterized by lower abdominal pain that can range from mild discomfort to intense, debilitating pain. Menstrual cramps typically occur just before or during menstruation and can last for a few hours to several days.
In addition to abdominal pain, individuals with menstrual cramps may experience other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, and mood changes.
Severe menstrual cramps can significantly disrupt daily activities and quality of life.

            <h1>In View Of Ayurveda</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Ayurveda has a cure for everything and painful menstrual cramps are no different. Here are Ayurvedic herbs that will soothe those raging menstrual cramps and bring you comfort.
                        Bleeding for those five days in a month is a reality of every woman’s life.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>During periods, your body uses up excess energy in cleansing the reproductive system of accumulated ama (toxins). New blood cells (Rakta Dhatu) are created to replenish the loss, and this is possible only when you allow your body to rest.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>However, you can’t deny that crankiness, mood swings, and painful cramps make your body and mind work overtime. Many, in fact, find it extremely tough to carry out even the daily activities due to menstrual cramps.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p> A member of the bleeding-heart family, Bhutakesi grows in the Himalayas, particularly around Kashmir. It is commonly prescribed for relief in period cramps.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

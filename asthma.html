                    Asthma is a chronic disorder of the lung, caused due to inflammation in the airways, which become narrower and fill with mucus. It ultimately blocks the airflow, which then results in short gasping breaths, causing wheezing, coughing and tightness of the chest. Asthma can be triggered by allergic reactions to irritants like dust, smoke, fumes or chemical allergens like pollen and grass. The underlying cause of all asthmatic conditions is-‘Increased Kapha dosha in Stomach’. From there it progresses into the lungs, trachea and bronchi. ‘Kapha’ is one of the three energies or doshas (Vata, pitta and Kapha) responsible for balancing the overall health.

            <h1>In View Of Ayurveda</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Bronchial Asthma is one of the most’ Fatal Respiratory Diseases’. It’s called ‘Tamaka Shvasa‘ [difficulty in breathing].
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The primary dosha associated with bronchial Asthma is the watery Kapha which leads to mucus formation. This accumulation leads to narrowing and obstruction of the arteries. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>As a result, there is an obstruction in the airflow of the lungs, causing ‘shortness of breath and difficulty in breathing’.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Symptoms</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Shortness of breath</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Chest tightness or pain</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Wheezing when exhaling, which is a common sign of asthma in children</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Trouble sleeping caused by shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Coughing or wheezing attacks that are worsened by a respiratory virus, such as a cold or the flu</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The need to use a quick-relief inhaler</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Causes</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Vata dosha:  This type of Asthma is caused due to physical or emotional stress. It could also be triggered by a diet that is dry and cold (qualities of Vata). It usually exhibits dry cough following an asthma attack, that could lead to drastic weight loss along with other symptoms of Vata deterioration. Vata Dosha is the most common type of dosha.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Kapha dosha. Consuming excessive cold and heavy foods or even overeating, can trigger this type. A wet cough will usually follow with an asthmatic episode. Mucus is cloudy in consistency and white. Those suffering from this type, may be overweight or show other signs of Kapha vitiation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Pitta dosha: Pitta vitiation can be a combination of Vata or Kapha type asthma. It is usually caused by exposure to allergens or microbes. The bronchial passages get inflamed, and the cough produced has a yellow or green mucus. </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

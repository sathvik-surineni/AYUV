                    Ayurveda refers to Dengue as a type of 'Dandaka Jwara', a fever caused by imbalance of the Vata,
                    Pitta and Kapha Doshas. In this fever, a person experiences severe pain in the bones and that is why
                    it is called Dandaka Jwara or break bone fever. During Dengue, the Pitta and Kapha doshas in the
                    body get aggravated, due to the increased activity of the bodyâ€™s defense mechanism to fight the
                    infection. This also imbalances the Vata dosha.In Ayurveda, the treatment aims to increase the
                    immunity of the individual with Ayurvedic herbs that help maintain the body temperature and increase
                    the platelet and white blood cell count.

                    <p>Ayurveda offers effective home remedies to help control and treat the symptoms of dengue. Here
                        are some of the remedies. Doing all of them together is not recommended, however, you may choose
                        a couple of them that work for you!

                    <p>Boost Immunity With Giloy
                        Giloy, a well-known immunity booster, helps in maintaining the metabolic rate, improving the
                        immune system, and increasing the platelet count. A herbal drink can be made by boiling two
                        small stems of Giloy plant in a glass of water until half a glass of water remains. Drink this
                        Giloy infused water twice a day. Giloy helps in balancing the tridoshas.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Increase Platelet Count With Papaya Leaf
                        As the need of the hour is to increase the platelet count, Ayurveda strongly prescribes the
                        papaya leaves juice for platelets. Papaya leaves juice also helps relieve tiredness, nausea, and
                        stomach problems. You can prepare papaya leaf juice by crushing its leaves and extracting the
                        juice. Drinking a small quantity of papaya leaf juice twice a day can offer great results.</p>

                    <p>Orange Juice or Sweet lime Juice For Dengue Fever
                        Oranges and Sweet Lime are rich in Vitamin C and antioxidants which help in building immunity.
                        Drinking orange or sweet lime juice is an elixir for a dengue patient. It helps keep the body
                        hydrated, increases urination, thereby releasing toxins from the body. Vitamin C in oranges
                        promotes antibodies that help fight Dengue fever.</p>

                            <p>Giloy contains antioxidants that can help combat oxidative stress in the body. This may reduce

                                reaction, such as itching, swelling, or difficulty breathing, discontinue use and seek immediate
                                medical attention.</p>

                            <p>Mulethi, also known as Licorice or Glycyrrhiza glabra, is a widely used herb in traditional
                                medicine systems, such as Ayurveda, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and Unani medicine. It
                                offers various potential health benefits</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Mulethi is known for its soothing properties and is often used to alleviate sore throat symptoms.
                                It can help reduce throat irritation and coughing.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p>While Mulethi (Licorice or Glycyrrhiza glabra) offers various potential health benefits, it's
                                important to be aware of the potential disadvantages and side effects associated with its use.
                                These disadvantages can occur when Mulethi is consumed in excessive amounts or used improperly.

                            <p>One of the most well-known disadvantages of Mulethi is its potential to raise blood pressure. It
                                contains a compound called glycyrrhizin, which can lead to sodium and water retention in the
                                body, ultimately causing an increase in blood pressure. Prolonged or excessive consumption of
                                glycyrrhizin-rich products, such as Mulethi, can lead to hypertension.</p>

                            have been used for centuries in traditional Ayurvedic and herbal medicine due to their numerous

                            area of skin to check for any adverse reactions.
